					<h2>History of Internet Research</h2>
					<time datetime="2017-04-20">April 20th, 2017</time>
					<p>Hers is the question I choose: Can apps and other Internet-based services completely take over the role websites play in the Internet?</p><p>My idea is that apps and other Internet-based services will not be able to take over the role of websites in the next few years.I think the reason we use apps is when mobile browser optimization can not meet the requirements of a variety of services. Then websites can be replaced by the APP to meet the user. And this situation is to create a huge APP market. However when the mobile browser to meet the APP independent service, naturally, the user will reduce the number of APP on their phone. Because it easier to forget some apps if you have a huge number of apps. On the other hand apps can only temporarily meet the needs of users. If the browser function is enough to replace app, I think the app will shrink but may not disappear. So, the conclusion is we need both apps and websites.</p><p>And from this question let me think another question is about the security of our website and apps. As the increasing of internet users, making network security becomes very important. We need to consider the security of the user's information, the exchange of information encryption to protect the company or personal information security</p>
