					<p> 						
						I am a student at the University of UC Davis, pursing B.S. degree in Computer Science. And my expected graduation date is March of 2018. This is my third year as a CS major undergraduate student. In this year I put more time on major classes like algorithm, computer network and computer architecture. I learned coding languages like Python and R. The design for the “Private File System” assisted me to gain profound knowledge in the field of Computer Science. I hope my technical skills will prove an asset to your organization and I have the chance to immediate my value to some company. I am interesting in learning new skills, I like the front end knowledge. So I took courses like Wed design and information interface to learn Javascript、HTML and CSS this quarter. I hope I can learn both front end and back end skills. I like my major. Also I still interested in product and business. So I hope I can be a person has both knowledge about business and computer science. Then I could be a project or product manager in few years later.
