			  <p>The predecessor of the carnival was the English transliteration of the "Carnival" in Europe. It originated in ancient Egypt and later became a celebration of the ancient Roman god festival. Over the years, the “Carnival” has gradually grown from a traditional festival to a public entertainment event that includes large-scale amusement facilities and supplemented with various forms of cultural and artistic activities. There are numerous carnivals around the world and they have become a symbol of many cities. </p>
